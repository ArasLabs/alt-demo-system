# Demo System (Alternative)

This is a snapshot of the Demo development system used by Peter and Marc. Nearly all of the community solutions are loaded, and the data examples cover a wide range of business applications.

The weekly (monday) webinars use the this database and vault. If you want a tour or some training on how to use this demo system, sit in on the webinar before installing.

NOTE: this is Peter's development system. They might be some bugs... and there are certainly some interesting Innovator tricks and UIs that are not in standard Aras Innovator. You are welcome to re-use anything you find useful.
